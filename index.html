                    <p>April 2012 - Present | Software Engineer, Senior Associate</p>
                    <p>I initially joined the team before the aquisition by Capital One &mdash; when we were still AmeriCommerce. I started as as a Support Agent
                        while specializing in helping customers with the front end of their site. After helping to more formally define our Agency Services division,
                        I have worked to evolve our standards and practices for taking on client work resulting in a higher quality delivery.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I work on our product with particular focus on bettering our customer's experience of our product. This has included projects 
                        to automate domain registration, SSL purchasing, and even prototyping a complete rewrite of our front end.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I work closely with our sales team to accurately scope and quote projects for our clients</p>

                    <!--<p>I joined the AmeriCommerce team in April 2012. I've helped build the agency services team working on projects for clients 
                                    on our platform. In this time we were acquired by Capital One and rebranded as <a href="https://www.sparkpay.com/">Spark Pay</a>. 
                                    In addition to client work, I've spear-headed projects to impact the customer experience of our app.</p>-->

                    <p>Born out of a desire for unrestrained creative control over a project and a serious gap for quality marketed products in the industry,
                        Texas Beard Company was created among friends and co-workers. We sold $500K in the first year, and grew 100% in the second year. I have 
                        been responsible for various landing pages and campaigns as well as building out integrations to help run the business more easily.
                        <!--<p>In the spring of 2014, I helped cofound <a href="https://www.texasbeardcompany.com">Texas Beard Company</a> with a few friends 
                                and coworkers. The front end site was a joint effort with another of the co-founders. I focused on a few landing pages and some 
                                back-end integrations to power our order fullfillment. We sold over $500k in the first year, and doubled that in 2015 </p>-->

                                <p><a href="https://github.com/shaynemartin91/JimmyClient">JimmyClient</a> is a small node client for ordering Jimmy John's. After 
                                ordering online many times an noticing that it was a single page app (written in Angular), I reverse engineered the web traffic 
                                to create the node client. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimmy-client">On NPM</a></p>
